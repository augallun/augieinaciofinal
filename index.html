    <h3>This parallel coordinates visualization displays soccer player transfer fees from the 2024-25 season alongside their performance statistics from the previous season. <a href="data/convertcsv.htm" target="_blank"> (dataset here)</a></h3>
    <h4 class ="sr-only">This chart shows that younger soccer players, especially attackers, generally command higher transfer fees during the 2024-25 season, while older players tend to be less expensive. Players with higher transfer fees also tend to have better performance stats, particularly in goals and assists. The highest goal tally is 28, the highest number of assists is 11, and the highest transfer fee is €75 million. At the low end, some players had 0 goals or assists, and the lowest transfer fee is €100,000.</h4>
